There are several Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that store information in Whois databases.

These databases provide IP addresses and AS numbers (ASNs). AS stands for autonomous system and is represented by a number (ASN). 

An autonomous system is nothing more than a collection of IP addresses (a network) and associated routers under the control of a single administrator (such as a company). 

The autonomous system also presents a common routing policy with respect to the Internet (i.e. via BGP).

These databases also store DNS information.

*Note: not all organizations have IP address blocks assigned to them. Some obtain IP addresses from their ISP or lease them from some other provider (such as a cloud entity). It is important to consider the results carefully and confirm with the client before attacking a band of IP addresses.*
