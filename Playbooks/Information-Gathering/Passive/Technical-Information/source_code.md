Accessible code repositories can provide insight into the technology that a target may be employing. There is also the possibility of data leakage. Credentials and other sensitive information can sometimes be discovered.

Note: this applies to internal tests that have a reachable code repository source as well.

Here are some popular sources:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)

Many online code repos offer the ability to search a codebase - something to look into based on the platform in use.

There are tools that can aid in searching code repositories.
