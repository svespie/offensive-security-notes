It may be a good idea to have a predefined plan on how to handle potential discoveries of critical vulnerabilities and/or evidence of an actual attack. 

Example:

```
INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN

1. Incident Detection: Use monitoring tools to detect anomalies.
2. Incident Reporting: Report detected incidents to [Contact Name] immediately.
3. Containment: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
4. Remediation: Apply necessary patches and changes.
5. Post-Incident Analysis: Conduct a review meeting to discuss the incident and preventive measures.
