Hyptertext Transfer Protocol

Includes HTTPS (HTTP secure)

The protocol defining the world wide web (WWW). Specifies how clients and servers should interact.

HTTP is stacked on top of TCP.

HTTP == TCP 80
HTTPS == TCP 443

HTTP services are commonly found on other ports, usually some analog of the default port numbers:
* TCP 8080
* TCP 8081
* TCP 8443
* etc.

Text based protocol using HTML (hyptertext markup language) along with other client side technologies used by modern web browsers.

Clients make requests to servers and the servers respond with responses. The structure of these are defined by a handful RFCs and due to ambiguity and/or an attempt at backward compatibility often provide wiggle room for attackers.
