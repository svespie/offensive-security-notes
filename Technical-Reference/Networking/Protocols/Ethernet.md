Most common protocol used to connect devices on the Link Layer (Layer 1) of the TCP/IP stack.

Ethernet networks use devices called switches and bridges to provide a logical boundary around physically connected machines.

Reduces the chance of collisions.

MAC addresses used at this layer to target specific or individual machines.

PDU = frame

Messages to another machine occur through frames, which contain the sender MAC as well as the destination MAC. The switch is able to establish the necessary physical link to the correct computer by inspecting the frame.

Destination MAC addresses are resolved via the ARP protocol (address resolution protocol).
